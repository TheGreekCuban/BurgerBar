# BurgerBar

This application uses mySQL, Express, Node.js and Handlebars.js on the backend. In addition it strictly adheres to the mvc format and even has a custom ORM with helper functions! On the front end I used a combination of Bootstrap, CSS and jQuery.

This is a full stack application that allows users to enter in their favorite burger. When it's time to eat, you can devour it! But don't worry, if you decide you want the same thing for lunch tomorrow, you can add it right back to the menu. 

It's very simple, just add the name of the burger into the textbox and click submit. Once you do that you'll see it on the menu. If you want to get rid of a burger completely simply click delete, but be careful though - there's no way to get that data back!
